    <h5> Who we are</h5>
    <p> We are Coding Bytes, an awesome 3 person group taking the amazing C# class at We Can Code IT, Summer 2022. 
       In this class, we were assigned to create a MVC program from start to finish. Working along side our instructors, we were able to execute this task. </p>

    <h5> Why School Supplies??</h5>
    <p> Excellent question! We chose the topic of school supplies because it is a topic that hopefully everyone can relate to. Hopefully you remember having binders and notebooks, and can't forget, writing utensils.
        I (Dina) remember always forgetting mine, and the teachers getting upset! <em>(insert sad face).</em> </p>
